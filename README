The silverstripe-gtkdoc module provides a new page type that imports
into the pages tree an ebook generated by gtk-doc. The only parameter
required by the CMS is the full path to a .devhelp2 file.

A newly created Gtkdoc page will pick up the HTML code directly from
the file system (the usual place where gtk-doc files are installed is
under /usr/share/gtk-doc/html/*/ or /usr/local/share/gtk-doc/html/*/).
There is no cache in-between, so the HTML pages shown by SilverStripe
are always up to date with those stored in the file system.

For better results, a theme that supports menu with arbitrary nesting
levels (such as silverstripe-treeish) is suggested.
